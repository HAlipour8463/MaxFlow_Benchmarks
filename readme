This directory contains programs that generate networks and graphs.
Most are in the DIMACS format. For the others, format translators 
are or will soon be available.  Generators suitable for multiple 
problems are in this directory---problem-specific generators appear
in subdirectories.  

This Directory Contains:

ac.c      : Generates a fully dense acyclic network in .max format. 
             A C version of waissi/ac.pas.  Submitted by J. Setubal

ak.c	  : The AK generator was designed by Goldberg and Cherkassky (1997) 
	    as a hard set of instances for push-relabel and Dinic's (1970) algorithms. 
	    Given a parameter k, the program generates a unique network with 4k + 6 nodes and 6k + 7 arcs. 
	    The instance does not depend on a random seed in that the graph, given the number of nodes, is unique.

ccd/      : A directory containing a shell script for generating all 
              maxflow instances for the DIMACS Core Experiments.  

genrmf/   : A directory containing files for the RMFGEN network generator.
             Networks are in .max format. 

geomasn.a : Awk language converter from DIMACS .geom format to a bipartite
            network in .asn format.  Read the file for more information. 

tg.c       :  Generates transportation grid networks. A C version of 
               waissi/tr.pas.  Contributed by J. Setubal.  

washington/ : A directory containing code for several max-flow generators.
