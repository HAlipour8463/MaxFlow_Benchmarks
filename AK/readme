# The AK generator was designed by Goldberg and Cherkassky (1997) as a hard set of instances 
for push-relabel and Dinic's (1970) algorithms. 

Given a parameter k, the program generates a unique network with 4k + 6 nodes and 6k + 7 arcs. 
The instance does not depend on a random seed in that the graph, given the number of nodes, is unique.
