# MaxFlow_Benchmarks

This repository includes benchmark generator software written in C and Pascal to generate benchmarks for the maximum flow problem (MFP) in DIMACS format. The original source is http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/generators/network/. These codes are modified a little for our purpose but they are basically as same as their original sources.
