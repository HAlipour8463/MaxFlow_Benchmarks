# MaxFlow_Benchmark_Generators

This repository includes benchmark generators written in C to generate benchmarks for the maximum flow problem (MFP) in DIMACS format. The original sources are from http://archive.dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/generators/network/. These codes are modified a little for our purpose but they are basically as same as their original sources.

You need to change directories in bash scripts according to your pwd.
